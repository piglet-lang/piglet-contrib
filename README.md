# Piglet-contrib

Assortment of useful modules. Piglet-contrib has a liberal contribution policy,
feel free to add whatever you have that seems useful, or to improve what's
there.

This is more of a staging ground. When things stabilize and seem generally
useful they will likely migrate to `piglet-lang`, or to separate packages.
